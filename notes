-Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-      brackets for this purpose.

-Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.

-an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() [used to get an iterator] and __next__().

-The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.

The except block lets you handle the error.

The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

The %run Command You can run any file as a Python program inside the environment of your IPython session using the %run command. Suppose you had the following simple script stored in ipython_script_test.py:
def f(x, y, z):    return (x + y) / z
a = 5 b = 6 c = 7.5
result = f(a, b, c) You can execute this by passing the filename to %run:
In [14]: %run ipython_script_test.py The script is run in an empty namespace (with no imports or other variables defined) so that the behavior should be identical to running the program on the command line using python script.py. All of the variables (imports, functions, and globals) defined in the file (up until an exception, if any, is raised) will then be accessible in the IPython shell:
In [15]: c Out [15]: 7.5
In [16]: result Out[16]: 1.4666666666666666 If a Python script expects command-line arguments (to be found in sys.argv), these can be passed after the file path as though run on the command line.
Should you wish to give a script access to variables already defined in the interactive IPython namespace, use %run -i instead of plain %run.
In the Jupyter notebook, you may also use the related %load magic function, which imports a script into a code cell:
>>> %load ipython_script_test.py
    def f(x, y, z):        return (x + y) / z
    a = 5    b = 6    c = 7.5



###    %load learning.ipynb  imports a script into a code shell     whereas 
	%run learning.ipynb  The script is run in an empty namespace (with no imports or other variables defined) so that the behavior should be identical to running the program on the command line using python script.py.

Binary search and maintaining a sorted list The built-in bisect module implements binary search and insertion into a sorted list. bisect.bisect finds the location where an element should be inserted to keep it sorted, while bisect.insort actually inserts the element into that location:
In [67]: import bisect
In [68]: c = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7]
In [69]: bisect.bisect(c, 2) Out[69]: 4
In [70]: bisect.bisect(c, 5) Out[70]: 6
In [71]: bisect.insort(c, 6)
In [72]: c Out[72]: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]

****note*****:::The bisect module functions do not check whether the list is sorted, as doing so would be computationally expensive. Thus, using them with an unsorted list will succeed without error but may lead to incorrect results





	##Errors and Exception Handling
 Handling Python errors or exceptions gracefully is an important part of building robust programs.
In data analysis applications, many functions only work on certain kinds of input. As an example, Python’s float function is capable of casting a string to a floating-point number, but fails with ValueError on improper inputs:
In [197]: float('1.2345') Out[197]: 1.2345
In [198]: float('something') --------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
 <ipython-input-198-439904410854> in <module>() 
----> 1 float('something') 
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'something'

Suppose we wanted a version of float that fails gracefully, returning the input argument. We can do this by writing a function that encloses the call to float in a try/ except block:

def attempt_float(x): 
   try:       
 return float(x)  
  except:      
  return x

 The code in the except part of the block will only be executed if float(x) raises an exception:
In [200]: attempt_float('1.2345') Out[200]: 1.2345
In [201]: attempt_float('something') Out[201]:'something' 

You might notice that float can raise exceptions other than ValueError:
In [202]: float((1, 2)) --------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
 <ipython-input-202-842079ebb635> in <module>() 
----> 1 float((1, 2)) 
TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number, not 'tuple'

 You might want to only suppress ValueError, since a TypeError (the input was not a string or numeric value) might indicate a legitimate bug in your program. To do that, write the exception type after except:
def attempt_float(x): 
   try:      
  return float(x)  
  except ValueError:  
      return x We have then:
In [204]: attempt_float((1, 2)) --------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

----> 1 attempt_float((1, 2))
 <ipython-input-203-3e06b8379b6b> in attempt_float(x)      1 def attempt_float(x):

    4     except ValueError:  
    5         return x 
TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number, not 'tuple' 

You can catch multiple exception types by writing a tuple of exception types instead (the parentheses are required):

def attempt_float(x):   
 try:       
 return float(x)    
except (TypeError, ValueError):   
     return x
